	title = {Towards {Visual} {Feature} {Translation}},
	abstract = {Most existing visual search systems are deployed based upon ﬁxed kinds of visual features, which prohibits the feature reusing across different systems or when upgrading systems with a new type of feature. Such a setting is obviously inﬂexible and time/memory consuming, which is indeed mendable if visual features can be “translated” across systems. In this paper, we make the ﬁrst attempt towards visual feature translation to break through the barrier of using features across different visual search systems. To this end, we propose a Hybrid Auto-Encoder (HAE) to translate visual features, which learns a mapping by minimizing the translation and reconstruction errors. Based upon HAE, an Undirected Afﬁnity Measurement (UAM) is further designed to quantify the afﬁnity among different types of visual features. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several public datasets with sixteen different types of widelyused features in visual search systems. Quantitative results show the encouraging possibilities of feature translation. For the ﬁrst time, the afﬁnity among widely-used features like SIFT and DELF is reported.},

In the framework of the CENSE project, these perceptual variables (presence ratios of traffic, voices and birds) have been estimated automatically, thanks to a deep learning process, from acoustic data collected on a network of sensors in the city of Lorient. The time evolutions of these sound presence ratios follow the day rhythm of the city (birds singing during the sunrise, regular pattern for the traffic, voices during weekends along the walking areas, etc.). In parallel a questionnaire sent to the population made it possible to propose a sound quality model adapted to the city of Lorient. The crossing of the measurements with the perceptual data is under process, as well as the development of a cartographic representation of the sound quality, with a focus on the presence of these sound sources.},
